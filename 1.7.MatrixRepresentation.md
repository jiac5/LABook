##Matrix representation
A **matrix** is an ordered list of vectors of the same dimension.  A matrix is shown as a grid of numbers enclosed within $[$ and $]$.
$$\begin{align*} A=\left[    \begin{array}{cccc}      5 & 3 & 2\\      5 & 7 & 2.4    \end{array}\right].\end{align*}$$

Each horizontal set of numbers represent a vector called a **row vector**, and each vertical set of numbers represent a vector called a **column vector**.  Ex: The first row vector of $A$ is a 3D vector $(5,3,2)$, and the second column of $A$ is a 2D vector $(3,7)$.

Matrix $A$ can be considered as a list of two 3D vectors $(5,3,2)$ and $(5,7,2.4)$, one below the other, or a list of three 2D vectors $(5,5)$, $(3,7)$, and $(2,2.4)$, one to the right of the other. The former interpretation is called the **row-major representation**, and the latter is called the **column-major representation**.

The size of a matrix is shown by (number of rows)$\times$(number of columns). Matrix $A$ above is of the size $2\times 3$ (read as “2 by 3”). The  element in the $i$th row and the $j$th column of matrix $A$  is represented as $a_{i,j}$. In the above example, $a_{2,3}=2.4$.

A vector $(3,5,7)$ can be represented as a $1 \times 3$ matrix $[3\ 5\ 7]$, which is called a **row matrix**; or  the vector $(3,5,7)$ can be represented as a $3 \times 1$ matrix $\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix}$, which is called a **column matrix**.

> Example of matrix representation

>- Matrix of timing of train stops in different stations
> To represent the times at which 4 trains would stop in 5 subsequent stations, a $4 \times 5$ matrix can be used. Each row is a train, and each column is a station, and each entry $a_{ij}$ is the time at which train $i$ arrives at station $j$.

>A person waiting in  a station will be interested in a particular column and a person sitting in a train will be interested in a particular row.
>- Matrix of price of fund prices on different days
> Each row is a day (M, Tu, W, $\ldots$), each column is a mutual fund, and each entry $a_{ij}$ is the price of fund $j$ on day $i$.

\begin{align*}
  A=
  \left[
    \begin{array}{cccc}
&Oil&IT&Telecom&Retail\\
M&1.2 & 0.6 & 1.3  & 2.5\\ 
T&1.1 & 0.5 & 1.2 & 2.6\\
W&1.1 & 0.7 & 1.1 & 2.7 \\
Th&1.2 & 0.5 & 1.0 & 2.8\\
F&1.1 & 0.4 & 1.0 & 3.0
    \end{array}
  \right]
\end{align*}
$$
> A person interested in buying a stock on a particular day will be interested in rows, and a stock market analyst analyzing the price variation of a fund will be interested in a particular column.
>- Given a matrix 
$$\begin{align*}
  A=
  \left[
    \begin{array}{cccc}
1 & \pi & 2.34  & 3.23\\ 
\sqrt{2} & 2.3 & 6.75 & 0\\
3 & 2.5 & -9.2 & 2.34
    \end{array}
  \right]
\end{align*}
$$
Third column vector of $A$ is $(2.34, 6.75, -9.2)$.
Second row vector of  $A$ is $(\sqrt{2},2.3,6.75, 0)$.
The scalar element at the position 2nd row and 4th column is $a_{2,4}$=$0$.

<!-- A workaround to separate the two blocks -->
> In computer programs a matrix is represented either as a list of vectors as shown above in numerical languages such as Matlab, or as an array of arrays also called as “2D array” in most other programming languages such as C, C++, or Java.
>For example,
>```
int    A[10][15];
float  B[15][23];
```
represent matrices in most programming languages.
